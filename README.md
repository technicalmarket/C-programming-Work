C tutorial Files
These files all written and tested using Dev-Cpp,Visual Studio code and code blocks IDE 
If you are interested in using Eclipse IDE (like me) then i will advice you to use a extra line in your main function

ex.
int main(void)               //<---------------In Eclipse you canot use main function with void return it should return int
{
  setbuf(stdout,NULL);      //<----------this line need to be added
  //your definations and declarations
  printf("!!!Hello World!!!");
  return EXIT_success;
}
Some of the parts in this code are kept commented which were code lines which I used for debugging purpose
Fill free to use the code and if you have any doubts comments me
Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!
