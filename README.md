If you are interested in using Eclipse IDE (like me) then i will advice you to use a extra line in your main function

ex.
int main(void)    
{
  setbuf(stdout,NULL);      //<----------this line need to be added
  printf("!!!Hello World!!!");
  return EXIT_success;
}
Some of the parts in this code are kept commented which were code lines which I used for debugging purpose
Fill free to use the code and if you have any doubts comments me
Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!
